            With each state having differing requirements for Posting,
            Publishing and Sales, STOX keeps up with the laws that govern the
            states that we do work in. We make sure that our auctioneers comply
            and meet all the requirements of that state. To make sure that your
            order makes it to sale, we audit our file to make sure that all the
            tasks and requirements are met. We want to make our clients
            comfortable knowing that they are sending their order to a company
            that cares.

            We have newspapers all over the states we cover. With all the
            newspapers available, we research their prices as well as their
            dependability and pick the publishing vendor that is most
            advantageous to our client. Because of our relationships with these
            newspapers, we can take care of urgent or late publishing requests
            that come in.
